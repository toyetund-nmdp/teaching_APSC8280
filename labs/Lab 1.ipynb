    "### This dataset includes annual county-level pesticide use estimates for 423 pesticides (active ingredients) applied to agricultural crops grown in the contiguous United States. Two different methods were used to estimate a range of pesticide use for all states except California. Both low and high estimate methods incorporated proprietary surveyed rates for United States Department of Agriculture Crop Reporting Districts, but the estimates differed in how they treated situations when a district was surveyed and pesticide use was not reported. Low estimates assumed zero use in the district for that pesticide; however, high estimates treated the unreported use of pesticides as missing data and estimated the pesticide usage from neighboring locations within the same region."
