# Course Description
This course aims to introduce graduate students in plant science to core concepts in machine
learning and data science. The course will separate hype from fact, demystify machine learning,
and critically examine prospects and limitations of data science as applied to plant science.
Lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects are designed to encourage students to think of ways of
applying machine learning to solve practical problems in their current and future research.
